Web Infrastructure Overview
This web infrastructure features the addition of a second server and the integration of a load balancer (HAproxy), significantly boosting reliability and scalability. The load balancer effectively distributes incoming traffic between the two servers, enhancing fault tolerance by mitigating single points of failure and ensuring smoother operation under varying loads.

Additional Elements
Second Server: Incorporating a second server into the infrastructure enhances reliability and fault tolerance by providing redundancy. This setup ensures that if one server encounters an issue, the other can continue to handle incoming traffic, minimizing the risk of downtime.

Load Balancer (HAproxy): The introduction of a load balancer facilitates the efficient distribution of incoming traffic across both servers. It improves scalability and performance by evenly spreading the workload, which prevents any single server from becoming overwhelmed.

Detailed Component Explanations
Distribution Algorithm: The load balancer employs a round-robin distribution algorithm, sequentially routing incoming requests across all servers in rotation. This ensures an equitable distribution of workload, maximizing resource utilization and maintaining performance across the infrastructure.

Active-Active vs. Active-Passive Setup: Our infrastructure utilizes an Active-Active setup, wherein all servers in the pool are engaged in handling requests simultaneously, offering enhanced efficiency and scalability. Contrarily, an Active-Passive setup would designate one server for active request handling and others in standby mode, serving as backups but not actively processing traffic until needed.

Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) Database Cluster: This setup involves a primary node responsible for all write operations, with replica nodes synchronizing with the primary to facilitate read operations. This arrangement ensures data consistency across the cluster and allows for the seamless takeover by a replica in the event of primary node failure, enhancing fault tolerance and read performance scalability.

Identified Infrastructure Challenges
Single Point of Failure (SPOF): Despite improvements, a single point of failure remains in the form of a solitary load balancer. Should the load balancer fail, the entire system's ability to distribute traffic would be compromised, leading to potential service disruptions.

Security Concerns: The current setup lacks essential security measures such as a firewall and HTTPS encryption, leaving the infrastructure vulnerable to external threats and potential data breaches.

Absence of Monitoring: Without a robust monitoring solution, it becomes challenging to proactively detect performance bottlenecks, security incidents, or system failures, hindering timely response and resolution of issues.
